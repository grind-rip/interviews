Solutions for the Amazon online assessment

---

## Overview

* You will have 105 minutes to complete 2 coding challenges and coding approach.
* There will be 2 surveys following the assessment; a work style survey (15 min) and feedback survey (5 min).
* You will have the option of coding in C, C++, C++14, C#, Go, Java7, Java8, Javascript, Kotlin, Objective-C, PyPy2, PyPy3, Python 2, Python 3, Ruby, Scala, and Swift.
* Efficiency and optimization, as opposed to brute force solutions, earn more points.
* Your code must compile for all code questions in order to move forward in the interview process.
* Be sure to test your code and ensure it runs before you submit your code or before time runs out.
* Ensure your solutions consider all edge cases and handle large inputs effectively. This is key to doing well in the assessment.

## Outcome

Flushed. I was able to put together two naive solutions (both O(n^2)), however this obviously won't cut it at Amazon. Looking back, this is when I thought using Go would make me look *smarter*. This was a dumb assumption and in reality just made the process of actually solving problems more difficult.

## Reflection

Amazon tries to bog you down with superfluous information in these types of problems. Unlike with LeetCode, where the problem statement is centered around a core algorithm, the problem statements for the online assessments are like short stories. This is probably aimed at preventing cheating while also testing a candidate's reading comprehension.
