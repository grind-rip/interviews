Solutions for the technical interview

## Overview

* Two 45-minute technical interviews: one easy, one medium.

## Outcome

Flushed. I was able to complete both coding problems, but they were looking for someone with more experience:

>It was years of experience - we really need additional mentorship at this time. You were a great candidate and I'll be sure to reach out in the future if a role opens up.

This was the first time I felt like I actually did well during a technical interview. Though looking back, the questions were super easy.

## Reflections

Probably dodged a bullet on this one. Judging by their [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/architect-io), Architect.io went out of business somewhere between July 2023 and January 2024.
