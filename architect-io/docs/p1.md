# Problem 1

Create a function. Takes in a string. Returns true if there are duplicate characters in the string otherwise returns false.

---

## Solution

Create a hash set (hash table), where each key is a character in the string. Loop over the string and add characters to the hash set if they are not already in it. If a character is already in the hash set, return true. Return false if the loop completes without finding a duplicate.

**NOTE**: Hash table lookups are O(1).

## Follow-Up

**What happens if the string is infinitely long?**

The string cannot be infinitely long, since, assuming a UTF-16 character set, once all the characters in the set are exhausted, you must begin to duplicate characters. This must occur at n+1, where n is the size of the character set.
