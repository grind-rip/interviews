# Problem 2

Given a list of trees (as pointers to their roots), return the biggest score of all nodes in all trees.

Definition of a `Node`:

```go
type Node struct {
	id       uuid.UUID
	score    int
	children []*Node
}
```

```go
func findBiggestScoreHelper(node *Node, biggestScore int) int {
	return 0
}
```

**NOTE**: Since trees are by definition acyclic (i.e., there is exactly one path to reach each node from the root), we do not need to maintain a list of visited nodes. This was an error on the interviewer's part, as the original function signature included `visited map[*Node]bool` in order to keep track of visited nodes.

## Solution

Using either breadth-first search or depth-first search, traverse each tree keeping track of the biggest score across all nodes.
