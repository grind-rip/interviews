# Problem 2

We have some clickstream data that we gathered on our client's website. Using cookies, we collected snippets of users' anonymized URL histories while they browsed the site. The histories are in chronological order, and no URL was visited more than once per person.

Write a function that takes two users' browsing histories as input and returns the longest contiguous sequence of URLs that appears in both.

**Sample Input**:

```
user0 = ["/start", "/green", "/blue", "/pink", "/register", "/orange", "/one/two"]
user1 = ["/start", "/pink", "/register", "/orange", "/red", "a"]
user2 = ["a", "/one", "/two"]
user3 = ["/pink", "/orange", "/yellow", "/plum", "/blue", "/tan", "/red", "/amber", "/HotRodPink", "/CornflowerBlue", "/LightGoldenRodYellow", "/BritishRacingGreen"]
user4 = ["/pink", "/orange", "/amber", "/BritishRacingGreen", "/plum", "/blue", "/tan", "/red", "/lavender", "/HotRodPink", "/CornflowerBlue", "/LightGoldenRodYellow"]
user5 = ["a"]
user6 = ["/pink","/orange","/six","/plum","/seven","/tan","/red", "/amber"]
```

**Sample Output**:

```
findContiguousHistory(user0, user1) => ["/pink", "/register", "/orange"]
findContiguousHistory(user0, user2) => [] (empty)
findContiguousHistory(user0, user0) => ["/start", "/green", "/blue", "/pink", "/register", "/orange", "/one/two"]
findContiguousHistory(user2, user1) => ["a"]
findContiguousHistory(user5, user2) => ["a"]
findContiguousHistory(user3, user4) => ["/plum", "/blue", "/tan", "/red"]
findContiguousHistory(user4, user3) => ["/plum", "/blue", "/tan", "/red"]
findContiguousHistory(user3, user6) => ["/tan", "/red", "/amber"]
```

Where,

* `n`: Length of the first user's browsing history
* `m`: Length of the second user's browsing history

## Solution

This is a "Longest Common Substring/Subarray" problem and can be solved using dynamic programming.

Given array A and array B, we deduce that, if a common subarray of A and B exists, it must end at some A[i] and B[j].

We let `dp[i][j]` be the longest common subarray of A and B for the subarray ending at i and j. For example, given the following arrays:

```
arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
arr2 = [4, 2, 3, 1]

dp =
       [0, 0, 0, 1]
       [0, 1, 0, 0]
       [0, 0, 2, 0]
       [1, 0, 0, 0]
```

Whenever A[i] == B[j], we know `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.

The maximum subarray is then `max(dp[i][j])` for all i and j. The length of the longest common subarray and the index of the last element in the subarray are maintained while iterating.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n*m). The space complexity is O(n*m).
