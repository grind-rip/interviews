# Problem 1

Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a palindrome, or `false` otherwise.

## Solution

This question is pretty much [125. Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome).

Use two pointers: one at the start of `s` and one at the end of `s`. If the character at `s[i]` is not the same as the character at `s[j]`, return `false`.

This question was so easy I was almost embarrassed I received it for a Senior Software Engineer interview. The interviewers also suggested I implement the solution recursively.
