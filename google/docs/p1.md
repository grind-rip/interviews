# Problem 1

Given a class `Company`, implement the following functions:

```python
def manager(employee: str, manager: str) -> None:
    """
    Indicates that employee is a direct report of manager.
    """
```

```python
def peer(employee: str, other: str) -> None:
    """
    Indicates that employee and other are peers (same manager).
    """
```

```python
def reports_to(employee: str, other: str) -> bool:
    """
    Returns True if employee reports directly or indirectly to other, otherwise
    returns False.
    """
```

---

## Solution

This is a simple tree problem. `Company` is an n-ary tree. The operations `manager()` and `peer()` add nodes to the tree. The operation `reports_to()` is a straightforward tree traversal.

**Why is this a tree problem?**

The problem can be modeled using a tree because the relationships of the entities (manager, employee, and peer) adhere to its properties, namely, that each node in the tree can be connected to zero or more children, but each node has exactly one parent. From this we can make the following assertions:
  * Each node is an employee.
  * Edges represent reporting relationships.
  * The root is the top-level manager.
  * Peer relationships can be derived by finding nodes that share the same parent (manager).

Initially, I used a hash table to keep track of nodes, however, this is unnecessary, since a node only needs to store its value and references to other nodes.

A node (employee) can be represented with the following class:

```python
class Employee:

    def __init__(self, id: str) -> None:
        self.id: str = id
        self.manager: Employee | None = None
        self.employees: list[Employee] = []
```
