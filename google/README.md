Solutions for the Google technical interview

---

## Overview

* One 45-minute technical interview (preliminary screen).

## Outcome

The rejection that started it all.

>I've received your initial screening feedback, and unfortunately the recommendation is not to move forward in the hiring process at this time.

## Reflection

This one got to me. I spent somewhere in the ballpark of 100 hours studying and couldn't even make it past the preliminary screen. FAANG is another level and if you want to make it, you have to be hardcore. In the end, this failure was a blessing because it galvanized my resolve to become something more than a pathetic casual.
